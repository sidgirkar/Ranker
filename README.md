# Ranker
A basic web app that facilitates the process of ranking schools during an FBLA conference. 
Often, calculations must be tediously done by hand, and this app eliminates that problem. 
The web app was created with HTML, CSS, Javascript, and the Jquery library.This repository 
also contains a Python program that performs the same function, but is less interactive and 
works solely through Terminal.
